# NPR One Sonos Service [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertique/SonosNPROneServer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertique/SonosNPROneServer)
I love my Sonos system and I really like the [NPR One app](http://www.npr.org/about/products/npr-one/). Thatâ€™s why I have built this service.

Most people probably just want to use the [hosted version](https://michaeldick.me/sonos-nprone/) to add it to your Sonos, but you can also run it yourself.

Issues and pull-requests welcome.
